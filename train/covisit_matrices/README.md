# Important Note

There are 20 co-visitation matrices in this folder. Three matrices use old CPU code. We suggest converting these 3 scripts into GPU code by following the template of the 17 GPU co-visitation matrices. This will provide a 30x speedup! Discussion [here][1] The GPU co-visit take 1-2 minutes whereas the CPU code takes 2-3 hours.
