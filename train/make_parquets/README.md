# Important Note

Before running `script.ipynb` in this folder, run Giba's code [here][1]. Afterward copy the file `embbedings_fm10.npy` into the folder `../../data/item_user_features`. The file `Make-172-G.ipynb` and `Make-174-G.ipynb` need this NumPy file. If the code doesn't have `embbedings_fm10.npy`, then the code will use alternative embeddings NumPy file and score slightly less CV and LB score.
